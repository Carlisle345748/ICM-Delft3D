# InfoWorks ICM-Delft3D

InfoWorks ICM-Delft3D is a coupled model which allow data to be passed between InfoWorks ICM and Delft3D. This model is currently built for tracing single point source pollution which originates from drainage system and spread into the connected river. The pollution tracing algorithm is developed on the basis of diffenential evolution algorithm.
